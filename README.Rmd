# vcapr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An R package to efficiently import and parse data extracts from the N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts VCAP system for civil court data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vcapr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcclatchy-southeast/vcapr")
```

## Usage

```{r}
# load the package
library(vcapr)

# import, parse and write a single file to a destination directory
# change this to wherever the raw files are stored on your machine
# and where you want to the separated files to be saved
process_results <- processCivilFile('/vcap/NOBC0001', '/vcap/tables/')

# loop through a series of files
# change this to wherever the raw files are stored on your machine
# and where you want to the separated files to be saved
# TODO Add a function like this to get a directory
#
# create a list of filenames
files <- c('/vcap/NOBC0001',
           '/vcap/NOBC0002',
           '/vcap/NOBC0003'
)
# loop through the filenames, processing each and producing a results file
for(file in files){
  if(!exists('process_results')){
    process_results <- processCivilFile(file, '~/Dropbox/projects/newsobserver/sfr_investors/data/aoc/2022/upload_test/')
  }
  else{
    process_results <- rbind(
      process_results,
      processCivilFile(file, '~/Dropbox/projects/newsobserver/sfr_investors/data/aoc/2022/upload_test/')
    )
  }
}
```

## Background
Data from the N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts is provided via public records request in a 5-year "extract" every six months. The agency exports its database into a sequential series of fixed-width 2.1 GB files made up of data from several tables.

Those tables fall into one of three categories:

* Cases records
* Abstract records
* Support records

Each of these three record categories has a number of associated record types, identified by a two-digit number that corresponds with a layout described [in the provided data dictionary](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23070366-nc-aoc-vcap-extract-file-layout).

This document, provided by the AOC, was manually translated into a CSV preloaded into the package.

### Preprocessing
A small number of rows in the AOC data appear to contain embedded nulls, non-UTF characters that R seems to interpret as line breaks. These appear in text editors as `<0x00>` characters, and are discoverable via `grep`.

```bash
grep '\x0' NOBC0004raw
```

Because they're interpreted as line breaks, they incorrectly increase the number of rows and make the resulting broken lines impossible to parse automatically.

To fix these embedded nulls, we can replace them with a space using a `perl` command in Terminal.

```bash
perl -pe 's/\0/ /g' < NOBC0017 > NOBC0017fix
```

The vcapr package attempts to catch other encoding issues and correct them during parsing.

## Other/old functions

In the process of moving away from these after refactoring. So consider everything below deprecated.

```{r}
# load the package
library(vcapr)

# import, parse and write a single file
processCivilFile('/vcap/NOBC0001', 'vcap/tables/')

#load all case record data from the civil extract into one dataframe
all_tables <- importFiles('c', civil_data_dict, 'path/to/raw/vcap/files/')

#examine the data dicionary
head(civil_data_dict)

#load all specifications per a specified data dictionary
all_specs <- loadAllSpecs(civil_data_dict)

#load relevant tables from civil data
issue_type <- loadCivilTable('../../aoc/2022/sep/NOBC23', all_specs)
party_names <- loadCivilTable('../../aoc/2022/sep/NOBC48', all_specs)
```

<!--You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.\-->
