Tools to efficiently import and parse data extracts from the N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts VCAP system for civil court data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vcapr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcclatchy-southeast/vcapr")
```

## Usage

```{r}
#load the package
library(vcapr)

#load all case record data from the civil extract into one dataframe
all_tables <- importFiles('c', civil_data_dict, 'path/to/raw/vcap/files/')

#examine the data dicionary
head(civil_data_dict)

#load all specifications per a specified data dictionary
all_specs <- loadAllSpecs(civil_data_dict)

#load relevant tables from civil data
issue_type <- loadCivilTable('../../aoc/2022/sep/NOBC23', all_specs)
party_names <- loadCivilTable('../../aoc/2022/sep/NOBC48', all_specs)
```

<!--You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.\-->
